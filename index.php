						<p>The Jalandhar Police Commissionerate has completed more than seven years. The main focus of commissionerate police has been on prevention and detection of crime; maintenance of law & order; better road safety for users through enforcement, regulation and education; and providing citizen friendly services.
						<span data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#col1">...</span></p>
						<p id="col1" class="collapse">
						At the same time many initiatives have been taken to ensure immediate and effective response of police to the emerging challenges on various fronts like rapid urbanization, emerging caste/class/communal tension, drug abuse etc. on one part and high expectations of citizens from the police service in the newly introduced system on the other part. Some of the initiatives like setting up of a modern Police Control Room; compounding branch of traffic wing; launching of Jalandhar traffic police website; establishing arms licensing branch, special police stations-NRI & women; ISO Certification of arms licensing branch, compounding branch of traffic wing & all police stations in Police Commissionerate Jalandhar; introduction of e-challaning, e-beat tracking system, e-investigation; separation of law & order and investigation wing in police stations; constitution of special investigation units etc. have been aimed in this direction only and have helped in achieving the main goals of Commissionerate Police.
						Jalandhar Police Commissionerate website is another stepping stone in this direction. It aims at providing easy and user friendly access to citizens regarding duties, functioning and related aspects of policing; laws of the land; activities of Jalandhar police; various police services like status of passport verification/PCC/Public Complaints/Arms License Applications, online filing of complaints, provision of secret information to police where identity of informer shall be kept secret, downloading of registered FIRs/Untraced Reports/PCCs and information about POs, missing persons, unidentified dead bodies, press releases etc. Also safety tips are provided to citizens for reducing their vulnerability to crime in an easy to understand way. In addition web links have been provided to related websites like Jalandhar traffic police and legal references.
						I am sure that citizens/users shall find the website useful and give constructive feedback so as to make it better the police public partnership. I urge the citizens to give correct and timely information to police so as to have an immediate and effective response from our side.

						<h1>Women Police Station</h1>
					</div>
					<div class="right-column-content-content">
						<p>In consequence of issuance of notification by the Government of Punjab vide No.S0-258/CA/1974, dated 22.07.2010, women police station has started functioning in the Commissionerate of Police, Jalandhar from 01.10.2010 onwards. It is suitably located near the district police lines, Jalandhar which is at the center of the city and close to railway station and bus stand.
						<span data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#col2">...</span></p>
						<p id="col2" class="collapse">
						This police station is a special police station that exclusively deals with the offences committed against females and other problems related to them. It deals with complaints related to demand for dowry, matrimonial disputes, investigation of crimes against women and sensitization of police personnel as well as general public about women and gender issues. FIRs related to crime against women are registered and investigated as per procedure laid down by law. It is headed by a lady inspector who functions as station house officer and is assisted by lady and gent investigating officers. ACP west branch and ADCP headquarter and security supervise the functioning of this police station.
						Over a period of time the women counselling technique involving serving police officers and civilian members in form of panel has emerged as an effective conflict resolution mechanism for establishing the veracity of facts stated in matrimonial dispute complaints and finding an effective solution to safe guard the rights of women and their children through active involvement of community members. At present 3 such panels are functioning in the women police station and doing a very good job. Regular training is imparted to panel members so as to sharpen their skills.
						Since its inception the Women Police Station has dealt with 3226 complaints related to matrimonial disputes. Out of these complaints, reconciliation was reached between the spouses in as many as 3121 cases due to effective counselling. 211 criminal cases have also been registered in the Police Station so far.
